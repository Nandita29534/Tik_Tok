    "TikTok users can report videos that they believe violate the platform's terms of service. Because there are millions of TikTok videos created and viewed every day, this means that many videos get reported&mdash;too many to be individually reviewed by a human moderator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis indicates that when authors do violate the terms of service, they're much more likely to be presenting a claim than an opinion. Therefore, it is useful to be able to determine which videos make claims and which videos are opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "TikTok wants to build a machine learning model to help identify claims and opinions. Videos that are labeled opinions will be less likely to go on to be reviewed by a human moderator. Videos that are labeled as claims will be further sorted by a downstream process to determine whether they should get prioritized for review. For example, perhaps videos that are classified as claims would then be ranked by how many times they were reported, then the top x% would be reviewed by a human each day.\n",

It's very important to identify videos that break the terms of service, even if that means some opinion videos are misclassified as claims. The worst case for an opinion misclassified as a claim is that the video goes to human review. The worst case for a claim that's misclassified as an opinion is that the video does not get reviewed _and_ it violates the terms of service. A video that violates the terms of service would be considered posted from a \"banned\" author, as referenced in the data dictionary.\n",

    "**Question:** Describe your XGBoost model results. How does your XGBoost model compare to your random forest model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Random Forest and XGBoost achieved a perfect recall of 1.00 for the “claim” class, meaning neither model misses actual claims. This satisfies the primary business requirement of minimizing false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, XGBoost outperforms Random Forest on secondary metrics. It achieves higher precision for the “claim” class (0.99 vs 0.97) and higher recall for the “opinion” class (0.99 vs 0.97). This indicates that XGBoost generates fewer false positives and makes more consistent predictions overall.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**\n",

    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n"
